*"Secure your AI agents. Lint your LLM-generated plans before they break things."*

## üö® Why Plan Linting Matters

Modern AI agents dynamically generate plans at runtime ‚Äî deciding what actions to take, what tools to call, what goals to pursue.
But LLMs hallucinate. Plans are often invalid, broken, unsafe, or even harmful

- Unsafe: Plans might trigger dangerous tool use (e.g., "delete all data")
- Invalid: Plans can miss mandatory parameters or violate tool schemas
- Incoherent: Plans can contradict agent goals or deadlock execution
- Unexecutable: Plans can reference missing tools or invalid operations

plan-lint is a lightweight open source linter designed to validate, catch, and flag these dangerous plans before your agents act on them.

Protect your users. Safeguard your agents. Build responsibly.


`plan-lint` is an **open-source static analysis toolkit** for LLM agent **plans**.

It parses the machine-readable plan emitted by a planner/brain, validates it against
schemas, policy rules, and heuristics, and returns Pass / Fail with an
annotated risk-score JSON.

## üì¶ Installation

### Using pip
```bash
pip install plan-lint
```

### From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cirbuk/plan-lint.git
cd plan-lint
pip install -e .
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

The simplest way to use plan-linter is to run it on a plan JSON file:

```bash
plan-lint path/to/plan.json
```

or use in your application
```python
from plan_lint import lint_plan

errors = lint_plan(plan_object)
if errors:
    print(errors)
```

For a more advanced usage, you can provide a policy file:

```bash
plan-lint path/to/plan.json --policy path/to/policy.yaml
```

## üìù Example Plan Format

```json
{
  "goal": "Update product prices with a discount",
  "context": {
    "user_id": "admin-012",
    "department": "sales"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-001",
      "tool": "sql.query_ro",
      "args": {
        "query": "SELECT product_id, current_price FROM products"
      },
      "on_fail": "abort"
    },
    {
      "id": "step-002",
      "tool": "priceAPI.bulkUpdate",
      "args": {
        "product_ids": ["${step-001.result.product_id}"],
        "discount_pct": -20
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "planner": "gpt-4o",
    "created_at": "2025-05-15T14:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## üìã Example Policy Format

```yaml
# policy.yaml
allow_tools:
  - sql.query_ro
  - priceAPI.bulkUpdate
bounds:
  priceAPI.bulkUpdate.discount_pct: [-40, 0]
deny_tokens_regex:
  - "AWS_SECRET"
  - "API_KEY"
max_steps: 50
risk_weights:
  tool_write: 0.4
  raw_secret: 0.5
  loop: 0.3
fail_risk_threshold: 0.8
```

For detailed information on creating policies, including advanced YAML policies and Rego policies with Open Policy Agent integration, see our [Policy Authoring Guide](docs/policy-authoring.md).

## üîç Command Line Options

```
Usage: plan-lint [OPTIONS] PLAN_FILE

Options:
  --policy, -p TEXT     Path to the policy YAML file
  --schema, -s TEXT     Path to the JSON schema file
  --format, -f TEXT     Output format (cli or json) [default: cli]
  --output, -o TEXT     Path to write output [default: stdout]
  --fail-risk, -r FLOAT Risk score threshold for failure (0-1) [default: 0.8]
  --help                Show this message and exit
```

## üß© Adding Custom Rules

You can create custom rules by adding Python files to the `plan_lint/rules` directory. Each rule file should contain a `check_plan` function that takes a `Plan` and a `Policy` object and returns a list of `PlanError` objects.

Here's an example of a custom rule that checks for SQL write operations:

```python
from typing import List

from plan_lint.types import ErrorCode, Plan, PlanError, Policy

def check_plan(plan: Plan, policy: Policy) -> List[PlanError]:
    errors = []
    
    for i, step in enumerate(plan.steps):
        if step.tool.startswith("sql.") and "query" in step.args:
            query = step.args["query"].upper()
            write_keywords = ["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]
            
            for keyword in write_keywords:
                if keyword in query:
                    errors.append(
                        PlanError(
                            step=i,
                            code=ErrorCode.TOOL_DENY,
                            msg=f"SQL query contains write operation '{keyword}'",
                        )
                    )
    
    return errors
```
